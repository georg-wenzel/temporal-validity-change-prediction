		<Title>Input</Title>
		<FormattedContent><![CDATA[
			In each HIT, you are shown a tweet (the &quot;<strong>Context Tweet</strong>&quot;), together with its &quot;<strong>Expected Lifetime</strong>&quot;.
			We label this tweet the context tweet because it provides context for the author's intents, actions, or beliefs.
			Each context tweet has time-sensitive information, that is, information expected to be relevant only for a certain amount of time.
			The &quot;expected lifetime&quot; annotation indicates how long a reader might expect the context tweet to contain relevant information.
			This lifetime may refer to ongoing or planned actions or events in the tweet
			(such as &quot;<em>I am reading a few short stories.</em>&quot; or &quot;<em>I will pick up my nephew from the game later.</em>&quot;)
			or general information that will become outdated in the future
			(such as &quot;<em>The weather is nice today.</em>&quot; or &quot;<em>This week is going great!</em>&quot;).

		<Title>Task</Title>
		<FormattedContent><![CDATA[
			Your task for each context tweet is to write several <strong>follow-up tweets</strong> that the author could have respectively followed up on the context tweet with.
			Each follow-up tweet you write should affect the lifetime of information in the <strong>context tweet</strong> in a specific way.
		]]></FormattedContent>
		<FormattedContent><![CDATA[
			Each HIT requires you to write three follow-up tweets:
			<ul>
				<li>One where the expected lifetime of information in the context tweet <strong>decreases</strong>.</li>
				<li>One where the expected lifetime of information in the context tweet <strong>remains unchanged</strong>.</li>
				<li>One where the expected lifetime of information in the context tweet <strong>increases</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			For the follow-up tweet with an <strong>unchanged lifetime</strong>, you should think of a tweet
			that still <strong>relates to</strong> the context tweet but does not change its expected information lifetime.
			In the other two cases, the follow-up tweet should directly affect the expected lifetime of the context tweet.
		]]></FormattedContent>
		<FormattedContent><![CDATA[
			For follow-up tweets that change the expected lifetime, you must also provide an estimate for how long
			the context tweet contains relevant information after considering the corresponding follow-up tweet.
			This estimate must be selected from a set of classes. Keep in mind that <strong>the new estimate you provide may not
			be the same as the original one.</strong>
		]]></FormattedContent>
		<Title>Example</Title>
		<FormattedContent><![CDATA[
			Let's look at a concrete example. Consider the following input:
			<ul>
				<li> Context Tweet: &quot;<em>Never thought I'd be in the capital. But here I am. Waiting for a train in DC</em>&quot;</li>
				<li> Expected Lifetime: 15-45 minutes</li>
			</ul>
			In this case, the main information in the context tweet is that the author is waiting on a train. We estimate this information
			is valid for <em>15-45 minutes</em> (i.e., after 45 minutes, we would not assume the author is still waiting on the train based
			on this tweet alone).
		]]></FormattedContent>
		<FormattedContent><![CDATA[
			One way to change the expected lifetime of the tweet is to add additional information through the follow-up tweet.
			For example, to <strong>decrease</strong> the duration for which the tweet is relevant,
			we could specify that the train is expected to arrive very soon:
			<ul>
				<li> Follow-up with decreased lifetime: &quot;<em>It's only a short wait, though. The train should arrive any minute now.</em>&quot;</li>
				<li> (New) expected lifetime: 5-15 minutes</li>
			</ul>
			When reading this follow-up tweet after the context tweet, a reader is more likely to assume a duration of <em>5-15 minutes</em> for the wait rather than
			the previously estimated <em>15-45 minutes</em>.
		]]></FormattedContent>
		<FormattedContent><![CDATA[
			Your follow-up tweet may also imply a change of plans, expectations, or intentions. For example, a typical method to increase the
			duration for which a tweet is relevant is to inform readers about a delay. To <strong>increase</strong> the expected lifetime, a possible
			follow-up could be:
			<ul>
				<li> Follow-up with increased lifetime: &quot;<em>They just announced a huge delay. Might as well go grab some food, I'm not getting out of here any time soon.</em>&quot;</li>
				<li> (New) expected lifetime: 2-6 hours</li>
			</ul>
			This specific follow-up tweet implies a relatively long delay. Note that the new expected lifetime may be any class that fits the criteria (increased/decreased lifetime) but may <strong>not</strong> be the same as the original estimate.
			Thus, it would also	be possible to imply that there is a shorter delay (as long as the new expected lifetime would exceed 45 minutes) or even provide a follow-up that increases the expected lifetime further.
			Another possible solution could be:
			<ul>
				<li> Follow-up with increased lifetime: &quot;<em>This city is really breathtaking. I've decided to stay the night here before leaving.</em>&quot;</li>
				<li> (New) expected lifetime: 1-3 days</li>
			</ul>
			Please, feel free to come up with creative and varied solutions.
		]]></FormattedContent>
		<FormattedContent><![CDATA[
			Finally, for the follow-up tweet with an <strong>unchanged</strong> lifetime, ensure that the follow-up tweet you write is still <strong>relevant</strong> to the context tweet.
			A completely unrelated follow-up is not considered an appropriate solution. Instead, write a tweet that talks about the same topic or situation but does not change
			for how long a reader would consider the context tweet to be relevant. In our example, such a follow-up tweet could be:
			<ul>
				<li> Follow-up with unchanged lifetime: &quot;<em>The train station looks really nice. I wonder if they renovated it recently?</em>&quot;</li>
			</ul>
			No new expected lifetime needs to be provided here, as it is not expected to change from the original estimate.
		]]></FormattedContent>
		<Title>Correctly Estimating The Updated Lifetime</Title>
		<FormattedContent><![CDATA[
			Understanding the concept of the lifetime estimate is essential to avoid errors.
			When estimating the expected lifetime of a tweet pair, your task is to estimate the duration between the time the <strong>context tweet</strong>
			was posted and the time the <strong>context tweet</strong> is no longer considered relevant.
			The follow-up tweet only provides further details for this estimate but is not itself a part of it.
		]]></FormattedContent>
		<FormattedContent><![CDATA[
			Let's look at an example:
			<ul>
				<li> Context Tweet: &quot;<em>I am waiting on a phone call, it should come through in the next 2 hours</em>&quot;</li>
				<li> Expected Lifetime: 45 minutes - 2 hours</li>
			</ul>
			Now consider the following follow-up tweet:
			<ul>
				<li> Follow-up with decreased lifetime: &quot;<em>There's the call already!</em>&quot;</li>
			</ul>
			Commonly, workers would annotate such a tweet with a lifetime of &quot;less than one minute&quot;. However, remember
			that the expected lifetime is always measured from the time the <strong>context tweet</strong> was posted. Thus, this expected lifetime
			implies that the phone call occurred less than one minute after the <strong>context tweet</strong> was posted.
			Note that the duration of the call itself and the duration of the author taking the call are not relevant here. Only the time for which the information &quot;I am waiting on a phone call&quot; is relevant matters.
			Thus, a lifetime of &quot;less than one minute&quot; is a possible annotation, although not very likely. A better annotation would be &quot;5-15 minutes&quot; or &quot;15-45 minutes&quot;
		]]></FormattedContent>
		<FormattedContent><![CDATA[
			Sometimes, a context tweet may contain several pieces of information, such as the following:
			<ul>
				<li> Context Tweet: &quot;<em>I'll take a nap and then do the dishes.</em>&quot;</li>
				<li> Expected Lifetime: 45 minutes - 2 hours</li>
			</ul>
			In this case, the following solution would be <strong>incorrect</strong>:
			<ul>
				<li> Follow-up with decreased lifetime: &quot;<em>That was a power nap. Now I'm ready to tackle those plates.</em>&quot;</li>
				<li> (New) expected lifetime: 1-5 minutes</li>
			</ul>
			Here, it is clear that the full duration of taking a nap <strong>and</strong> doing the dishes should be longer than 5 minutes.
			While only doing the dishes may take less than 5 minutes, the context tweet also mentions taking a nap. As mentioned,
			the lifetime estimate encompasses the entire duration for which the context tweet is relevant.

			Guidelines
		</Title>
		<FormattedContent><![CDATA[
			<p>
				<strong>Do not submit an altered version of the context tweet.</strong><br />
				A common error source is workers attempting to change the context tweet itself. As shown in the example,
				your task is to write <strong>follow-up tweets</strong> to the context tweet.
				As a guideline, imagine you are the author of the context tweet and are trying to
				write a follow-up to communicate an update or further information to your audience.
				Additionally, <strong>each follow-up tweet</strong> should be considered independent of the others
				(one tweet pair consists of the context tweet and a single follow-up tweet).
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Follow-up tweets that change the lifetime may not produce the same expected lifetime estimate.</strong><br />
				For follow-up tweets that should decrease or increase the expected lifetime of the context tweet, the resulting
				estimate you provide must be a <strong>different class</strong> from the original expected lifetime. For example,
				if the original expected lifetime is &quot;15-45 minutes&quot;, your follow-up tweet that increases the lifetime
				must result in an estimated lifetime of <strong>at least</strong> &quot;45 minutes - 2 hours&quot;. For the
				follow-up that decreases the lifetime, the updated estimate must be <strong>at most</strong> &quot;5-15 minutes&quot;.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>The goal is to change the lifetime of information in the context tweet.</strong><br />
				Another common misconception is that the updated lifetime annotation is for both the context- and the
				follow-up tweet, especially when trying to increase the information lifetime.
				However, the expected lifetime <strong>always</strong> refers to the <strong>context tweet only</strong>.
				In our example, a follow-up tweet such as &quot;<em>After taking the train, I will go to the cinema.</em>&quot;
				would be unsuitable since the lifetime of information in the context tweet does not change.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>When the context tweet is unclear, give your best effort.</strong><br />
				Sourced tweets may sometimes be written in colloquial or unclear language.
				If you think the context tweet uses unclear language, make a best-effort attempt at solving the task.
				However, simply submitting a follow-up such as &quot;<em>can't think of something</em>&quot;
				or &quot;<em>unclear context tweet</em>&quot; is not acceptable and will be rejected.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Try to avoid using explicit temporal expressions.</strong><br />
				Where possible, try to avoid using explicit temporal expressions altogether and instead use implicit temporal frames of reference
				(e.g., other actions or events humans can relate to specific durations via common sense).
				You may still use temporal expressions to write your follow-up tweets. However, avoid follow-ups such as
				&quot;<em>I am waiting for the train for a few hours</em>&quot;, which simply state the action's duration without further context.
				A pattern of low-effort submissions can result in a revocation of your qualification or even rejections.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Be creative.</strong><br />
				This task is effectively a creative writing task. Our goal is to collect a wide variety of reasons why the information lifetime
				of text may decrease or increase. Try to write varied follow-up tweets with different scenarios that change the expected information lifetime.
			</p>
